hey guys and welcome back
[Music]
to my name is Chad chat really and there
is a new show on A&E the same network
that brought us such bangers As Dog the
Bounty Hunter Storage Wars and Billy the
Exterminator I've got to take every
shortcut I
can adults adopting adults is the new
hot Goss online it's the new thing but I
wasn't sure I wanted to make a video on
this because I've seen that people have
already talked about it but then I
watched the first episode in a moment of
weakness and it was way way worse than I
thought I'm already not a huge fan of
reality TV because it's usually not
reality king just cheated on me oh my
god seriously I am going to
end his career oh in living as a
successful businessman okay yeah okay if
his business was breathing no there's
actually a lot of reasons for adult
adoption like foster kids wanting to be
adopted by their foster parents or step
kids who have become adults who want to
be adopted by their step parents so
adult adoption isn't inherently strange
but this is reality TV guys they can't
make a show about healthy
relationships get that out of here so
the show starts out introducing us to
the different couples who are looking to
adopt an adult and immediately one
couple sticks out to us Danny and
Christie Danny and Christie have this
really interesting dynamic where Danny
is super excited to welcome their new
family member and Christy is not at all
not even a tad actually we learned that
christe straight up does not want to
adopt the woman that they are in the
process of adopting and has even said so
multiple times we live in chicoy Ohio
it's her and I that's our entire family
except for all of our critters Christy
has way too many cats okay but if you're
adopting a whole person Danny I feel
like christe's allowed to have a few
cats you know baby I know you don't want
to adopt an adult pregnant woman and
bring her here to live with us and
financially support her even though
we've only known her for three months
but you have more than one cat so you
kind of ow me we can't have children of
our own I'm an only child and I realized
that I had no one in my life to be my
legacy Danny explains that he needs to
leave behind his legacy of wearing
tie-dye shirts and making women feel
uncomfortable which totally justifies
his interest in adoption as long as the
adoptee is a woman and young and
attractive don't adop opon came to my
attention when a young 18-year-old girl
came and bought a puppy from us her
father had passed away years before and
I just felt a need to help her in some
way she was interested this isn't the
first time this is a pattern so then he
admits that he developed romantic
feelings for the first woman that he
tried to adopt
unfortunately I could not pursue that
that first young lady because I actually
started having feelings for her she was
a very beautiful young lady and expects
us to believe that this time it'll be
completely different because that is
what happens when you do the same thing
the exact same way twice something
different happens TR to you what's your
motivation is love for our family he and
I being the family I love how they just
cut her off like they've been letting
Danny ramble about his creepy
motivations for this and then barely let
her get a sentence in if I had to guess
I think she was saying that she's being
supportive because it's the only way to
keep their family together is by letting
him do whatever the he wants the
way that chrisy is clearly opposed to
this and it's still happening and her
even saying that Danny gets what he
wants no matter what she says makes me
feel like I have front row seats to an
emotionally abusive relationship and I
did not buy tickets I just went on the
internet and I was like I would like
some light-hearted cringe please for one
thank you and then the ticket person
kicked me in the head and said actually
you you're going to feel really sad now
and so you're going to really hate Danny
also that ticket will be $8,000
throughout their entire introduction
Danny constantly references a
fatherdaughter relationship and talks
about how much he wants to be a father
figure for Elana she looked at me as a
father figure and I see
her as my daughter I've always wanted a
a daughter in my life and then right
after that he makes a joke about her
giving him fellacio which despite
sounding like it is not a frozen Italian
dessert what do you want this thing to
say well I don't I know what would you
want it to say if it was my poster I'd
want it to say welcome to Ohio where's
my blowy
but you knew it you knew what I why you
got to be such a freak Show why are you
always such a naked girls I don't know
what kind of fatherdaughter
relationships Danny has been seeing but
I don't think you could have said
anything more inappropriate in this
moment this is not something that you
joke about to a daughter and if it is go
pack your biks we're going to jail well
you are not me I'll get you an Uber
despite this being something that only
Dany wants Christy seems to be bearing
the brunt of the responsibility as far
as coordinating Elana's travel and
making a place for her to stay Danny
mostly just follows her around and asks
the hard-hitting questions like did you
get her a pillow and what happens if I
cheat on you how are you going to be
with us spending time together alone so
what do we do if I like cheat on you or
something um well have you maybe just
considered not doing that right okay but
when if I cheat on you what are are you
going to do to fix it I guess I would
forgive you if you let me get another
cat
perfect he he's been unfaithful in the
past and it almost ended us then Iana
came along and I
thought he's really doing this again
christe you don't deserve this I will
adopt you okay you can come live with me
you can divorce Danny you can have as
many cats as you want and I'll even let
you keep your deodorant in the fridge I
don't know why you would want to put
your deodorant in the fridge maybe Dany
wants his pits to be so chilly that
Kevin Malone would drop them on the
floor I most certainly am very very
concerned that I may become physically
attracted to
Ilana this is a delicate subject but so
far I have not thought of her as a
beautiful woman she is I am very very
concerned that I may
steal the Declaration of Independence
and this is a sensitive topic so far I
have not thought of stealing the
Declaration of Independence I mean I
have I did I did steal it I did steal
the Declaration of Independence what was
the question what's your favorite type
of ice cream oh like Sofer froo
flatio yeah I'm calling the police nut
lots and lots of nut Elana runs into
some issues at the air report and Danny
is freaking out and trying to get over
there as quickly as he can baby we need
to move we got to go we need to move
right now as if Eliana is going to
change her mind about living with them
in the time it takes Christy to refill
her water bottle Christy I need you to
move faster the
water hey hi how are you doing hold on
this is the contact picture you chose
for your potential daughter you don't
put your kids contact picture with them
bareh shouldered and moist parents
choose a picture that your mom posts
posted on Facebook 5 years ago and her
friends called you pretty even though
you had corn stuck in your
braces they start to wonder if she was
catfishing them for the money that
they've apparently been sending her but
she does eventually show up oh that's
her yep yep it
is it
is he keeps making references to how he
looks forward to their relationship
developing but always includes physical
things I got to get in hug oh my God
can't
I had to wait for my hug she's cute as
the day is long I like hugging on you
and you're you know you're awful sweet
he's like the creepy guy that asks
where's my hug 2 seconds into any social
interaction and you're
like I don't know and then he's like oh
what so I don't get a hug I see how it
is and then he legally adopts you they
ask Aliana if she has any idea why
Christy was hesitant and she only
references the aspect of her potentially
using them for money the problem I think
was there was just not kny me thinking
maybe I'm a scam because it's not a
normal thing adult adoption is not a
normal thing that adults are looking for
family all the time so it doesn't seem
like she has any idea about this dude's
infidelity or the young woman that he
already tried to adopt who he fell in
love with they just didn't mention it to
her before she came all this way that's
what you're supposed to do in New
relationships like this support each
other quality time and keep things from
them until it's too late to back out the
three of us we're just going to be a
family we're going to share things so
christe if you you were willing to
share our marital problems this would be
a perfect place for you to do it Elana
just got here yesterday so it does seem
a bit early to be like oh by the way we
did this before and it almost ruined our
marriage so please don't do that welcome
to your new home I think it's
fascinating that when talking about
adopting Elana he says things like she
needs me Elana needs me or she wants to
be with me she she wants to be with me
or she entrusted me
with her life Iana has entrusted me with
her life but when we're talking about
the shitty things he's done all of the
sudden it's our marital issues and we
have had issues in the past our marital
problems so he is able to act like
they're a partnership but only when he's
trying to make it sound like they both
fell in love with a 19-year-old if you
were willing to
share our marital problems this would be
a perfect place for you to do
it no
it's not just Danny's fault I'm sure the
filming crew or whoever was like why
don't you ask Christy a super sensitive
question in front of everyone while we
stick a camera in her face we need tears
for the trailer
[Music]
to
conclude Danny sucks hey it's editing
Chad it's been a few days since I filmed
this and I just found out that A&E
completely cancelled this show already
they pulled it from their website and
every streaming service that it was on
thank God and Dany is also racist so
you're welcome for this update I'll talk
to you later okay love you bye Christy
needs to find someone who likes her cats
and takes her feelings into
consideration before making huge huge
life decisions A&E also sucks for using
christe's obvious distress as a hook for
their show and I highly doubt that
Christy wanted to be on the show in the
first place because she seems pretty
unhappy with the camera being around in
short everything about this sucks and I
hated it but you can let me know what
you think in the comments or you cannot
leave a comment because I respect your
opinion do you see how I did that Danny
I'm going to call it there guys thank
you for subscribing and if you are still
here thankk you so much for watching I
appreciate you clicking on my video out
of all the videos that are on here and
I'll see you next time okay bye
